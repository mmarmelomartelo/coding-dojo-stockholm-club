                    <H2>What is Coding Dojo?</H2>
                    <p>Just like martial arts, the dojo is an environment for learning. This concept must be
                        reinforced to everyone participating in it.
                        Besides that, it’s an environment where we apply the concepts of Pair Programming to solve a
                        challenge given by the dojo master.
                        The challenge resolution isn’t an obligation to call it a successful dojo; the main goal is
                        to be a fun experience for everyone.
                        A dojo can be done remotely, but the face-to-face one is where the magic happens.</p>
                    <h2>Dojo Setup</h2>
                    <p>A room or place with some seats
                        Only one computer where people will code
                        A big screen or projector where the crowd can see the coding</p>

                        <h2>The Coding Dojo Flow</h2>
                        <p>
                        It has cycles of 5 to 7 minutes, which can be changed. Still, for beginners, it’s recommended
                        that the cycle don’t be too big to avoid someone getting stuck at some logic and invite more
                        people to go to the computer to code (I personally like it to be 5 minutes).
                        The pilot is the only one who codes and can’t be interrupted by the audience during a cycle. The
                        pair programming is happening with the co-pilot, the only person allowed to give opinions about
                        the code.
                        The audience remains quiet until the end of each cycle. Some people like to make quick pauses
                        when the tests are passing to discuss something with the audience, which is fine. Still, when
                        the tests fail, any audience interaction with the pilot and co-pilot is not allowed.
                        At the break of each cycle, both pilot and co-pilot share their toughs of what they are doing
                        with the audience. The pilot goes back to the audience, the co-pilot goes to the pilot seat, and
                        someone from the audience (preferably who has not coded yet) assumes the co-pilot seat
                        voluntarily.
                        That will repeat all along with the dojo until the challenge is solved or the dojo time is up
                        (around 40 minutes to one hour and a half).</p>
                        <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
                        <p>Pair Programming is a technique used at the dojo and at programming environments to improve
                        teamwork and share knowledge. It is basically two people working together at a computer to solve
                        a problem by talking about it, giving opinions on the implementation, helping to remember how to
                        do something, and collaborating as a team towards the solution.</p>

                        <p>The flow of a coding dojo is pretty much like that:</p>
                        <h2>Finishing the Coding Dojo</h2>
                        <p>At the end of e dojo, it’s a good practice to get all the pros and cons about that experience
                        and get suggestions about what can be done to improve the next dojo session.
                        All the participants get their names on the dojo list, and the code and the feedback are posted
                        in a public repo to inspire others to make their own dojos.</p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        At the dojo, the most important thing is to learn and have fun learning, this was just some tips
                        from my experience at Coding Dojos.
